"""Repo-owned seed data for the curated topical shelves.

The literal that ``manage.py seed_topics`` plants in the ``Topic`` /
``TopicBook`` tables, kept in a module of its own for the same reason
``language_seed.py`` and ``topic_translations.py`` are: the seed command pulls
in ``django.core.management`` and ``library.models``, and not every reader of
this data can afford that.

``library/covers.py`` is the reader that forced the split. It is deliberately
Django-free — ``scripts/localize_covers.py`` and
``scripts/build_cover_assets.py`` import it as a plain module with no
``django.setup()`` — and it needs to know which topic a book belongs to, so it
can draw that topic's emblem on the book's generated cover.

This stays the single source of truth for topic membership. It is deliberately
NOT exported to a data file the way the emblem drawings are: those have to
cross into the API image, this does not, and a copy is a thing that drifts.

"""Create the curated topical shelves from books already in the library.

Idempotent: a topic is created only if its slug doesn't exist yet, and its
membership is upserted each run (new books added to existing topics as the
library grows). Members are soft slug-references — a slug that isn't present in
a given language simply doesn't appear on that language's shelf, so a topic can
be seeded ahead of a book landing. Run on deploy (see release.py).

Topic titles/descriptions are seeded in English; per-language translations live
in ``TopicTranslation`` and are filled by review later — the shelf falls back to
the English title in the meantime (the same way an untranslated book shows its
English title). This mirrors ``seed_plans``, whose curated prose is English too.
